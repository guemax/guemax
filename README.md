# I am using GitHub under protest

Personal projects are hosted on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/guemax), be
sure to check it out!

I still use GitHub to contribute to free software that is only hosted here.
This is not ideal; GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret and profit-driven
platform that doesn't care about your privacy or your project's license (see
Microsoft's Copilot). As long as free software is hosted on GitHub, I feel
compelled to continue to have an account, as very few projects provide further
contribution options. Nevertheless, it is important to
[draw attention to this problem](https://GiveUpGitHub.org).
