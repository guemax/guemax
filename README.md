$ echo $ABOUT_ME
* 🏡 I am a programmer based in Germany.
* 🐛 I am creating bugs since 2020.
* 🗨️ I started using Python, made a few websites using HTML, CSS,
     (a little bit of) JavaScript and PHP, but switched back to
     using Python and Django for some personal projects [1].
* 📑 I am now working on The Digital Logbook, a command-line
     application for tracking your computer usage times [2].

$ echo $IMPORTANT_NOTICE
Since I recently enabled vigilant mode, almost all commits before
June 30, 2023 have been marked as "unverified". You can learn more
about vigilant mode in the GitHub docs [3].

$ echo $OTHER_IMPORTANT_STUFF
I've recently switched to Codeberg as my primary code hosting
platform. Although I mirror some of my repositories to GitHub,
main development happens at https://codeberg.org/guemax.

Be sure to have a look at this page as well!
