* 🗨️ I started using Python, made a few websites using HTML, CSS,
     (a little bit of JavaScript and PHP, but switched back to
     using Python and Django for some personal projects [1].
* 📑 I am now working on The Digital Logbook, a command-line
     application for tracking your computer usage times [2].
